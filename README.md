# crypto-lstm-predictor

## Overview
LSTM-based cryptocurrency price trend predictor. Features: custom LSTM with attention, technical indicators, data preprocessing, configurable pipeline, and classification metrics. Forecasts short-term crypto trends (up/down/neutral) using historical data.
## Project Structure

- **config/**: Contains configuration files for the project.
  - `config.yaml`: Main configuration file that needs to be edited to match the CSV datasets.
  
- **logic/**: Contains the implementation of the models and files for testing.
  - `models/lstm_dyn_attention_classification.py`: LSTM model with a dynamic attention mechanism based on volatility, classification based on the predicted price change percentage
  - `models/lstm_dyn_attention_regression.py`: LSTM model with a static attention mechanism for price prediction
  - `models/lin_regression.py`: Linear regression model for price prediction
  
- **results/**: Stores results, logs, and other output files generated by the models.
  
- **scripts/**: Contains utility scripts.
  - `binance_scraper.py`: Script to download cryptocurrency data from Binance.
  
- **src/**: Includes data preprocessing and utility functions.
  - `data_preprocessing/`: Functions for data preprocessing and transformation.
  - `utils/`: Miscellaneous utility functions.

## Setup and Instructions

### 1. Download the Data

First, download the required cryptocurrency data using the Binance scraper:

```bash
python scripts/binance_scraper.py
```

This will download the data and save it as CSV files in a specified directory.

### 2. Configure the Project

Edit the `config/config.yaml` file to specify the paths to your CSV datasets. 
The current configuration is set to 3m data for BTCUSDT from 2020-01 to 2024-01.

Update these paths if necessary.

### 3. Run the Models

To run the models, choose one of the following commands:

- For the LSTM model with attention:

```bash
python logic/models/lstm_dyn_attention_classification.py
```

- For the linear regression model:

```bash
python logic/models/lin_regression.py
```

The results will be saved in the `results/` directory.

## Additional Information

This project uses PCA to reduce the dimensionality of cryptocurrency price data before applying models. The LSTM model incorporates an attention mechanism to improve the prediction accuracy by focusing on relevant features.
